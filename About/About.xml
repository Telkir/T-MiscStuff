  <description>Miscellaneous additions that don't really fit anywhere else.

● Scrap metal walls that are fast and cheap to build but extremely weak
● A threat sensor can be built in unroofed space to provide data to alert lamps
● Alert lamps that will change colour depending on how many hostile pawns are nearby

Special mentions and thanks to folks who have contributed:

● Shinzy - artwork for scrap metal walls</description>
